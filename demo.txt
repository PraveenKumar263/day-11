CDN: Content Delivery Network

Load the plugins/components from https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css to your 
project. (imagine like a python library, you access this library via the internet - CDN)
So you just need to copy the template of the component you want to use
e.g. <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-xOolHFLEh07PJGoPkLv1IbcEPTNtaed2xpHsD9ESMhqIYd0nLMwNLD69Npy4HI+N" crossorigin="anonymous">

Components and options for laying out your Bootstrap project, including wrapping containers, 
a powerful grid system, a flexible media object, and responsive utility classes.

Containers is all about holding the elements/objects
Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are required when using our default grid system.
Note: You don't use nested container
